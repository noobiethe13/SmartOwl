[The project is still under development, I will be trying to push daily commits to add new features] 

[The most important feature that I am planning to implement is an AI moderation of communities using Gemini and the Firebase genkit]

SmartOwl is a Reddit clone made using Flutter & Dart, with Riverpod state management, & Firebase as a backend & following a clean code architecture. However, unlike Reddit where any kind of information is shared, this app focuses on the creation of communities & sharing of posts, that can used as a source of know"OWL"edge or learning for people/professionals across various fields & domains.
